#Overview

Last year in my neighborhood in Brooklyn, there was a giant chalkboard wall with the simple prompt: "Before I die I want to…".  Next to it was a bucket of chalk.  And within days it was full!
 
It was a simple idea and it brought out the wonderful, funny, lewd, inspiring, stupid, silly, and pasionate feelings of the community as well as created it's own community around it.

(For more on the wall, please check out their fantistic project page [beforeidie.cc](http://beforeidie.cc/))

A few days later, I was drinking white russians with a friend and I kept saying "If I was king…" and then any number of stupid proclamtions.  But it echoed the excitement I felt by the simple prompt, Before I die I want to… 

I thought it'd be a cool web application but various events conspired against me making it happen, primary of which was the fact I didn't know how to code.  Anyway, when it came time to do our first project at GA - this was a natural choice.

#Technologies

This is a simple rails app running on Heroku and using postgres.   It uses several gems and started to delve into some javascript as you can see in the experimental section.

Gems

* devise
* thumbs_up
* geocoder
* gmaps4rails

Framework

* skeleton

Using the gems was an interesting process - in that alot of the work involved on the project was configuring the gems and/or just learning how they worked.  Additionally, alot of the examples that I found were confusing and working through how to orient one's self to a new gem was interesting.

The existing business logic is fairly simple with no amazing tricks in their yet.

#Where To Go From Here

###Community

Dependent on some additional functionality, I envision a community developing around the sharing and discussion of people's ideas for a world they would like to see.  

Also, with no small ammount of faith in the human race, I hope that the community would be self-policing, self-sustaining, and ultimately reflect a hopeful, optimistic direction for our society and natural world.

###Functionality 

Discussion!  There are various mechanisims I have thought about for this but I think I come down on wanting to see some primary thesis and then a primary critique, and then grouping pro and con conversations around the defense and critique.

Additional ideas include:

* policing
* winning
* selecting geographies of ideas
* competition within geographies and sub-groups
* tagging
* idea searching
* and ultimately the ability to surface general population sentiments.  

###Design

I wish the web site could mirror some of the energy, chaos, and communal feeling of the original wall.  I'm not sure how exactly to do that, but it's something to shoot for.
